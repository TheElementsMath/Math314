Whether you’re building a recommendation engine, analyzing trends in large datasets, or training neural networks, a strong grasp of the mathematical tools in this book is essential. Linear algebra enables the representation and manipulation of high-dimensional data, while calculus allows us to model change, optimize systems, and understand continuous processes. These concepts form the theoretical backbone of algorithms, models, and methods you’ll encounter in applied work. This book is structured to support active learning. Alongside explanations and examples, you’ll find practice problems designed to build both conceptual understanding and procedural fluency. Some sections are accompanied by videos, but please note: Watching videos and reading the textbook is not enough. Mathematics is a discipline learned through doing. To succeed, you must engage actively with the problems, test your understanding, and reflect on your mistakes. We also emphasize the importance of classroom participation. Showing up matters. So does coming prepared. Each lecture builds on the previous one, and your ability to follow along in class depends heavily on reviewing prior content and attempting the exercises. Think of the classroom as a lab: the place where ideas are tested, questions are raised, and insights are deepened—not a substitute for preparation. Why This Material Matters for Data Science and Machine Learning Linear Algebra: Vectors, matrices, and linear transformations are core to machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, support vector machines, neural networks). Understanding eigenvalues and singular value decomposition (SVD) helps in data compression and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA. Differential Calculus: Optimization is central to training machine learning models and relies on gradients and partial derivatives. Understanding how functions change and how to find their extrema is crucial in model tuning. Integral Calculus: Integral concepts appear in probability theory (e.g., continuous distributions), computing expected values, and even in formulating loss functions. They also underpin techniques in signal processing and statistical mechanics used in advanced models. By grounding your study in these topics, you’ll develop the tools needed not only to use data science tools, but to understand and innovate with them. Disclaimers While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the material in this workbook, no guarantee is offered regarding correctness or completeness. Errors may exist in explanations, examples, or answers. Please be proactive in checking your work and consulting with instructors or peers when something seems unclear. Moreover, this text is not a substitute for a college or university course, a professor’s guidance, or your own discipline and initiative. It is a companion — a structured guide to help you on your learning journey. A Final Word Mastery in mathematics comes not from memorizing formulas, but from struggling productively through problems, asking good questions, and connecting concepts. This workbook invites you to do all of those. Let’s begin.

Rule: The output is constant for every value of \\(x\\). General Linear Equation Equation: \\[ y = mx + b \\] Graph: A straight line with slope \\(m\\) and y-intercept \\(b\\). Rule: Linear functions increase or decrease at a constant rate. Quadratic Function (Parabola) Equation: \\[ y = ax^2 + bx + c \\] Graph: A U-shaped curve: - Opens upward if \\(a &gt; 0\\) - Opens downward if \\(a &lt; 0\\) Vertex: The turning point of the parabola. Axis of Symmetry: A vertical line through the vertex. Cubic Function Equation: \\[ y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\] Graph: An S-shaped curve that may have one or two turning points depending on coefficients. Rule: Cubic functions change curvature and direction. Reciprocal Function Equation: \\[ y = \\frac{1}{x} \\] Graph: - Two curved branches. - Undefined at \\(x = 0\\). Asymptotes: - Vertical: \\(x = 0\\) - Horizontal: \\(y = 0\\) Absolute Value Function Equation: \\[ y = |x| \\] Graph: A V-shaped graph with the vertex at the origin \\((0, 0)\\). Rule: Negative inputs are reflected to positive outputs. 1.1.2 Finding the Domain of a Function Rational Functions Example: \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{x - 3} \\] Rule: Exclude any value of \\(x\\) that makes the denominator zero. Domain: All real numbers except \\(x = 3\\). Square Root Functions Example: \\[ f(x) = \\sqrt{x - 2} \\] Rule: The expression under the square root must be non-negative. Domain: All real numbers \\(x \\geq 2\\). 1.1.3 Solving Systems Using the Elimination Method Two Equations in Two Unknowns Steps: Multiply one or both equations so that one variable has the same (or opposite) coefficient. Add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable. Solve for the remaining variable. Substitute back to find the other variable. Example: \\[ \\begin{align*} 2x + 3y &amp;= 12 \\\\ 4x - 3y &amp;= 6 \\end{align*} \\] Add the two equations: \\[ (2x + 3y) + (4x - 3y) = 12 + 6 \\\\ 6x = 18 \\Rightarrow x = 3 \\] Substitute \\(x = 3\\) into the first equation: \\[ 2(3) + 3y = 12 \\Rightarrow 6 + 3y = 12 \\Rightarrow y = 2 \\] Solution: \\(x = 3, \\quad y = 2\\) 1.1.4 Revenue, Cost, and Profit Functions Video: Supply and Demand Models Video: Linear Functions and Models Revenue Function Formula: \\[ R(x) = p(x) \\cdot x \\] Where: - \\(R(x)\\): Revenue - \\(p(x)\\): Price per unit - \\(x\\): Quantity sold Cost Function Formula: \\[ C(x) = \\text{Fixed Cost} + \\text{Variable Cost} \\cdot x \\] Fixed Costs: Constant (e.g., rent, salaries) Variable Costs: Depend on production level Profit Function Formula: \\[ P(x) = R(x) - C(x) \\] Profit is the difference between revenue and cost. Demand Function A typical linear demand function: \\[ p(x) = a - bx \\] As quantity \\(x\\) increases, price \\(p\\) usually decreases. This represents an inverse relationship between price and demand. 1.2 Practice Problems Find the equation of the straight line through the points (3,4) and (5,2).

To create one: Write the coefficients of the variables from each equation into rows. Add a vertical line (conceptually) separating the coefficients from the constants on the right-hand side. Example: For the system \\[\\begin{align*}x + 2y &amp;= 5\\\\ 3x - y &amp;= 4 \\end{align*}\\] The augmented matrix is: \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; | &amp; 5 \\\\ 3 &amp; -1 &amp; | &amp; 4 \\end{bmatrix} \\] 2.1.2 Elementary Row Operations There are three types of elementary row operations used in row reduction: Row Swapping (Ri ↔︎ Rj) Swap two rows. Row Scaling (k·Ri) Multiply a row by a non-zero constant. Row Replacement (Ri + k·Rj → Ri) Add or subtract a multiple of one row to another row. These operations are used to transform a matrix into a simpler form without changing the solution to the system. 2.1.3 Gauss-Jordan Elimination Steps Gauss-Jordan Elimination is a method to solve a system of linear equations by transforming the augmented matrix into reduced row echelon form (RREF). Steps: Write the augmented matrix for the system. Use elementary row operations to get a leading 1 (pivot) in the top-left corner. Create zeros below and above the pivot. Move to the next row and repeat the process for the next pivot (diagonal). Continue until you have 1s down the diagonal and 0s elsewhere in the coefficient part. Read the solution directly from the matrix. Goal: Transform the matrix into: \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 &amp; | &amp; a \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 &amp; | &amp; b \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots &amp; | &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 1 &amp; | &amp; c \\end{bmatrix} \\] Which corresponds to the solution \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), etc. 2.2 Practice Problems Use Gauss-Jordan to solve: \\[ \\begin{cases} 2x + y = 2 \\\\ -2x + y = 2 \\end{cases} \\] Use Gauss-Jordan to solve: \\[ \\begin{cases} 2x - 3y = 1 \\\\ 6x - 9y = 3 \\end{cases} \\] Use Gauss-Jordan to solve: \\[ \\begin{cases} x + y = 1 \\\\ 3x - 2y = -1 \\\\ 5x - y = \\frac{1}{5} \\end{cases} \\] Use Gauss-Jordan to solve: \\[ \\begin{cases} x - y + z - u + v = 1 \\\\ y + z + u + v = 2 \\\\ z - u + v = 1 \\\\ u + v = 1 \\\\ v = 1 \\end{cases} \\] Use Gauss-Jordan to solve: \\[ \\begin{cases} x + 2y + 3z + 4w + t = 6 \\\\ 2x + 3y + 4z + 5w + t = 5 \\\\ 3x + 4y + 5z + w + 2t = 4 \\\\ 4x + 5y + z + 2w + 3t = 3 \\\\ 5x + y + 2z + 3w + 4t = 2 \\end{cases} \\] (APPLIED) You own a hamburger franchise and want to use leftover ingredients to make burgers.

Then the 2-norm is: \\[ \\| \\mathbf{v} \\| = \\sqrt{2^2 + (-3)^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 9 + 36} = \\sqrt{49} = 7 \\] Denoted as |v|. Also called the 2-norm. 5.1.4 Cosine of the Angle Between Two Vectors Given non-zero vectors u and v, the cosine of the angle θ between them is: \\[ \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}}{\\|\\mathbf{u}\\| \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|} \\] Example: Let u = ⟨1, 2⟩ and v = ⟨3, 4⟩ Compute dot product: \\[ \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 1 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot 4 = 3 + 8 = 11 \\] Compute norms: \\[ \\|\\mathbf{u}\\| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{5}, \\quad \\|\\mathbf{v}\\| = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\] Use the cosine formula: \\[ \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{11}{\\sqrt{5} \\cdot 5} = \\frac{11}{5\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5} \\cdot \\frac{11}{5} \\] Find angle: \\[ \\theta = \\cos^{-1}\\left( \\frac{11}{5\\sqrt{5}} \\right) \\approx 18.4^\\circ \\] If cos(θ) = 0, the vectors are orthogonal (perpendicular). If cos(θ) &gt; 0, angle &lt; 90° (acute). If cos(θ) &lt; 0, angle &gt; 90° (obtuse). 5.1.5 Vector Projection Formula The projection of vector u onto vector v is: \\[ \\mathrm{proj}_{\\mathbf{v}} \\mathbf{u} = \\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}}{\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2} \\right) \\mathbf{v} \\] Example: Project u = ⟨2, 3⟩ onto v = ⟨1, 4⟩. Dot product: \\[ \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 2 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 2 + 12 = 14 \\] Norm squared: \\[ \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2 = 1^2 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17 \\] Projection: \\[ \\mathrm{proj}_{\\mathbf{v}} \\mathbf{u} = \\left( \\frac{14}{17} \\right) \\mathbf{v} = \\left( \\frac{14}{17} \\right) \\langle 1,\\ 4 \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{14}{17},\\ \\frac{56}{17} \\right\\rangle \\] Gives the component of u in the direction of v. 5.1.6 Geometric Interpretations Addition: Geometrically, vector addition corresponds to placing the tail of v at the head of u and drawing the resulting vector from the tail of u to the head of v. Dot Product: Measures alignment. A large positive value means the vectors point in similar directions. Norm: The “length” of the vector in Euclidean space. Projection: Drops a perpendicular from u onto v; the projection lies along v. Angle and Cosine: Relates direction and orthogonality. 5.2 Practice Problems Draw the vectors \\(A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}\\) and \\(B = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}\\).

If the eigenvector changes length, it does so by a factor of the eigenvalue. 8.1.2 Finding Eigenvalues (for \\(2 \\times 2\\) or \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrices) Start with the matrix equation \\(A\\vec{v} = \\lambda\\vec{v}\\). Rearrange to \\((A - \\lambda I)\\vec{v} = 0\\). Compute the characteristic polynomial by solving: \\[ \\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0 \\] The roots \\(\\lambda\\) of this polynomial are the eigenvalues of \\(A\\). 8.1.3 Finding Eigenvectors Once you have the eigenvalues: For each eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\), plug it into \\(A - \\lambda I\\). Solve the homogeneous system: \\[ (A - \\lambda I)\\vec{v} = 0 \\] The solution set (null space) gives the eigenvectors. Any basis for this null space forms a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to \\(\\lambda\\). 8.1.4 Diagonalization (for \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrices with two distinct eigenvalues) A matrix \\(A\\) is diagonalizable if there exists an invertible matrix \\(P\\) and a diagonal matrix \\(D\\) such that: \\[ A = PDP^{-1} \\] To diagonalize: Find the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2\\). For each \\(\\lambda\\), find the corresponding eigenvectors. Form matrix \\(P\\) using the eigenvectors as columns. Construct diagonal matrix \\(D\\) with the eigenvalues on the diagonal. Confirm that \\(A = PDP^{-1}\\). Diagonalization simplifies matrix powers and exponentials, as: \\[ A^n = P D^n P^{-1} \\] when \\(A\\) is diagonalizable. 8.2 Practice Problems Practice the techniques discussed in class and in the online videos by solving the following examples.
