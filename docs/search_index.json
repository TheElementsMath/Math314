Whether youre building a recommendation engine, analyzing trends in large datasets, or training neural networks, a strong grasp of the mathematical tools in this book is essential. Linear algebra enables the representation and manipulation of high-dimensional data, while calculus allows us to model change, optimize systems, and understand continuous processes. These concepts form the theoretical backbone of algorithms, models, and methods youll encounter in applied work. This book is structured to support active learning. Alongside explanations and examples, youll find practice problems designed to build both conceptual understanding and procedural fluency. Some sections are accompanied by videos, but please note: Watching videos and reading the textbook is not enough. Mathematics is a discipline learned through doing. To succeed, you must engage actively with the problems, test your understanding, and reflect on your mistakes. We also emphasize the importance of classroom participation. Showing up matters. So does coming prepared. Each lecture builds on the previous one, and your ability to follow along in class depends heavily on reviewing prior content and attempting the exercises. Think of the classroom as a lab: the place where ideas are tested, questions are raised, and insights are deepenednot a substitute for preparation. Why This Material Matters for Data Science and Machine Learning Linear Algebra: Vectors, matrices, and linear transformations are core to machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, support vector machines, neural networks). Understanding eigenvalues and singular value decomposition (SVD) helps in data compression and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA. Differential Calculus: Optimization is central to training machine learning models and relies on gradients and partial derivatives. Understanding how functions change and how to find their extrema is crucial in model tuning. Integral Calculus: Integral concepts appear in probability theory (e.g., continuous distributions), computing expected values, and even in formulating loss functions. They also underpin techniques in signal processing and statistical mechanics used in advanced models. By grounding your study in these topics, youll develop the tools needed not only to use data science tools, but to understand and innovate with them.

Rule: The output is constant for every value of \\(x\\). General Linear Equation Equation: \\[ y = mx + b \\] Graph: A straight line with slope \\(m\\) and y-intercept \\(b\\). Rule: Linear functions increase or decrease at a constant rate. Quadratic Function (Parabola) Equation: \\[ y = ax^2 + bx + c \\] Graph: A U-shaped curve: - Opens upward if \\(a &gt; 0\\) - Opens downward if \\(a &lt; 0\\) Vertex: The turning point of the parabola. Axis of Symmetry: A vertical line through the vertex. Cubic Function Equation: \\[ y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\] Graph: An S-shaped curve that may have one or two turning points depending on coefficients.

Domain: All real numbers except \\(x = 3\\). Square Root Functions Example: \\[ f(x) = \\sqrt{x - 2} \\] Rule: The expression under the square root must be non-negative. Domain: All real numbers \\(x \\geq 2\\). 1.2.3 Solving Systems Using the Elimination Method Steps: Multiply one or both equations so that one variable has the same (or opposite) coefficient. Add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable. Solve for the remaining variable. Substitute back to find the other variable. Example: \\[ \\begin{align*} 2x + 3y &amp;= 12 \\\\ 4x - 3y &amp;= 6 \\end{align*} \\] Add the two equations: \\[ (2x + 3y) + (4x - 3y) = 12 + 6 \\\\ 6x = 18 \\Rightarrow x = 3 \\] Substitute \\(x = 3\\) into the first equation: \\[ 2(3) + 3y = 12 \\Rightarrow 6 + 3y = 12 \\Rightarrow y = 2 \\] Solution: \\(x = 3, \\quad y = 2\\) 1.2.4 Revenue, Cost, and Profit Functions Revenue Function Formula: \\[ R(x) = p(x) \\cdot x \\] Where: - \\(R(x)\\): Revenue - \\(p(x)\\): Price per unit - \\(x\\): Quantity sold Cost Function Formula: \\[ C(x) = \\text{Fixed Cost} + \\text{Variable Cost} \\cdot x \\] Fixed Costs: Constant (e.g., rent, salaries) Variable Costs: Depend on production level Profit Function Formula: \\[ P(x) = R(x) - C(x) \\] Profit is the difference between revenue and cost. Demand Function A typical linear demand function: \\[ p(x) = a - bx \\] As quantity \\(x\\) increases, price \\(p\\) usually decreases. This represents an inverse relationship between price and demand. 1.3 Examples 1.3.1 Applications of Linear Equations Video: Solutions Find the final amount of money in an account if $2700is deposited at 5.5% interest compounded quarterly (every 3 months) and the money is left for 5 years.

To create one: Write the coefficients of the variables from each equation into rows. Add a vertical line (conceptually) separating the coefficients from the constants on the right-hand side. Example: For the system \\[\\begin{align*}x + 2y &amp;= 5\\\\ 3x - y &amp;= 4 \\end{align*}\\] The augmented matrix is: \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; | &amp; 5 \\\\ 3 &amp; -1 &amp; | &amp; 4 \\end{bmatrix} \\] 2.2.2 Elementary Row Operations There are three types of elementary row operations used in row reduction: Row Swapping (Ri  Rj) Swap two rows. Row Scaling (k·Ri) Multiply a row by a non-zero constant. Row Replacement (Ri + k·Rj  Ri) Add or subtract a multiple of one row to another row. These operations are used to transform a matrix into a simpler form without changing the solution to the system. 2.2.3 Gauss-Jordan Elimination Steps Gauss-Jordan Elimination is a method to solve a system of linear equations by transforming the augmented matrix into reduced row echelon form (RREF). Steps: Write the augmented matrix for the system. Use elementary row operations to get a leading 1 (pivot) in the top-left corner. Create zeros below and above the pivot. Move to the next row and repeat the process for the next pivot (diagonal). Continue until you have 1s down the diagonal and 0s elsewhere in the coefficient part. Read the solution directly from the matrix. Goal: Transform the matrix into: \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 &amp; | &amp; a \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 &amp; | &amp; b \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots &amp; | &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 1 &amp; | &amp; c \\end{bmatrix} \\] Which corresponds to the solution \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), etc. 2.3 Examples Video: Solutions When is a matrix in Row Echelon Form?

Scalar Multiplication: For scalar c, c·v = c·v, c·v, , c·v. Example: Let u = 1, 2, 3 and v = 4, -1, 2 Then: \\[ \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v} = \\langle 1 + 4,\\ 2 + (-1),\\ 3 + 2 \\rangle = \\langle 5,\\ 1,\\ 5 \\rangle \\] Example: Let v = 2, -3, 4&gt; and and scalar c = 3. Then: \\[ 3 \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\langle 3 \\cdot 2,\\ 3 \\cdot (-3),\\ 3 \\cdot 4 \\rangle = \\langle 6,\\ -9,\\ 12 \\rangle \\] These operations preserve vector direction (in the case of addition) or scale the magnitude (in scalar multiplication). 5.2.2 Standard Inner Product (Dot Product) The standard inner product (dot product) of vectors u and v in  is: \\[ \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2 + \\cdots + u_n v_n \\] Example: Let u = 1, 2, 3 and v = 4, -1, 2 Then: \\[ \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 1 \\cdot 4 + 2 \\cdot (-1) + 3 \\cdot 2 = 4 - 2 + 6 = 8 \\] Returns a scalar. Measures how much one vector goes in the direction of another. 5.2.3 Euclidean Norm of a Vector The Euclidean norm (or magnitude/length) of a vector v is: \\[ \\| \\mathbf{v} \\| = \\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \\cdots + v_n^2} \\] Example: Let v = 2, -3, 6. Then the 2-norm is: \\[ \\| \\mathbf{v} \\| = \\sqrt{2^2 + (-3)^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 9 + 36} = \\sqrt{49} = 7 \\] Denoted as |v|. Also called the 2-norm. 5.2.4 Cosine of the Angle Between Two Vectors Given non-zero vectors u and v, the cosine of the angle  between them is: \\[ \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}}{\\|\\mathbf{u}\\| \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|} \\] Example: Let u = 1, 2 and v = 3, 4 Compute dot product: \\[ \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 1 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot 4 = 3 + 8 = 11 \\] Compute norms: \\[ \\|\\mathbf{u}\\| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{5}, \\quad \\|\\mathbf{v}\\| = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\] Use the cosine formula: \\[ \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{11}{\\sqrt{5} \\cdot 5} = \\frac{11}{5\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5} \\cdot \\frac{11}{5} \\] Find angle: \\[ \\theta = \\cos^{-1}\\left( \\frac{11}{5\\sqrt{5}} \\right) \\approx 18.4^\\circ \\] If cos() = 0, the vectors are orthogonal (perpendicular). If cos() &gt; 0, angle &lt; 90° (acute). If cos() &lt; 0, angle &gt; 90° (obtuse). 5.2.5 Vector Projection Formula The projection of vector u onto vector v is: \\[ \\mathrm{proj}_{\\mathbf{v}} \\mathbf{u} = \\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}}{\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2} \\right) \\mathbf{v} \\] Example: Project u = 2, 3 onto v = 1, 4. Dot product: \\[ \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 2 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 2 + 12 = 14 \\] Norm squared: \\[ \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2 = 1^2 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17 \\] Projection: \\[ \\mathrm{proj}_{\\mathbf{v}} \\mathbf{u} = \\left( \\frac{14}{17} \\right) \\mathbf{v} = \\left( \\frac{14}{17} \\right) \\langle 1,\\ 4 \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{14}{17},\\ \\frac{56}{17} \\right\\rangle \\] Gives the component of u in the direction of v. 5.2.6 Geometric Interpretations Addition: Geometrically, vector addition corresponds to placing the tail of v at the head of u and drawing the resulting vector from the tail of u to the head of v. Dot Product: Measures alignment. A large positive value means the vectors point in similar directions. Norm: The length of the vector in Euclidean space. Projection: Drops a perpendicular from u onto v; the projection lies along v. Angle and Cosine: Relates direction and orthogonality. 5.3 Examples Video: Solutions Consider the following vectors: \\[ \\vec{v} = \\langle -11, -2 \\rangle, \\quad \\vec{z} = \\langle 6, 5 \\rangle \\] Compute: \\[ \\vec{v} + \\vec{z} \\] Consider the following vector: \\[ \\vec{v} = \\langle 8, -6 \\rangle \\] Find: \\[ \\|\\vec{v}\\| = \\ ? \\] The equation \\(ax + by = c\\) corresponds to the vector \\(\\langle a, b, c \\rangle\\).

Observe how the function values \\(f(x)\\) behave. If the values approach a single number, that is the estimated limit. Example: If \\(f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}\\), use values close to 1 (e.g., 0.9, 0.99, 1.01, 1.1) to estimate \\(\\lim_{x \\to 1} f(x)\\). 10.2.2 Use Factoring to Evaluate Limits Factoring helps eliminate indeterminate forms like \\(\\frac{0}{0}\\). Steps: Factor the numerator and denominator. Cancel common factors. Substitute the limit value. Example: Evaluate \\(\\lim_{x \\to 2} \\frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2}\\): \\[ \\frac{(x - 2)(x + 2)}{x - 2} = x + 2 \\Rightarrow \\lim_{x \\to 2} = 4 \\] 10.2.3 One-Sided Limits and Vertical Asymptotes Left-hand limit: \\(\\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x)\\) Right-hand limit: \\(\\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x)\\) If the function approaches infinity or negative infinity near a point, it may indicate a vertical asymptote.

Steps: Identify the highest power term in the numerator and denominator. Divide all terms by the dominant power of \\(x\\). Simplify and take the limit. Example: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{3x^2 + 5}{x^2 - 2x} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{3 + 5/x^2}{1 - 2/x} = \\frac{3}{1} = 3 \\] 10.2.5 Continuity of Piecewise Functions To determine if a piecewise function is continuous at a point: Check function is defined: \\(f(a)\\) exists.

Assign \\(x\\), \\(y\\), etc., to represent the quantities in the problem. Write the system of inequalities. These represent the constraints. Graph each inequality: Convert to an equation to graph the boundary. Use a solid line for \\(\\leq\\) or \\(\\geq\\), dashed for \\(&lt;\\) or \\(&gt;\\). Shade the correct side of each line. Identify the feasible region: The region where all shaded areas overlap. It must also satisfy non-negativity constraints (e.g., \\(x \\ge 0\\), \\(y \\ge 0\\)). Label the corner (vertex) points of the feasible region. These are typically found at the intersections of constraint lines. 21.0.2 Maximizing the Objective Function Once the feasible region is identified and corner points are known, the objective function can be evaluated. 21.0.2.1 Steps: Write the objective function: Usually in the form \\(P = ax + by\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are constants. Plug each corner point into the objective function to calculate \\(P\\). Compare the results: The largest value is the maximum. The smallest value is the minimum, if needed. State the optimal solution: Report both the point \\((x, y)\\) and the maximum value \\(P\\). 21.1 Example Maximize \\(P = 3x + 5y\\), subject to: \\[ \\begin{align*} x + y &amp;\\le 4 \\\\ x &amp;\\le 2 \\\\ y &amp;\\le 3 \\\\ x, y &amp;\\ge 0 \\end{align*} \\] Feasible Region: - Graph constraints and find the overlapping area.
