## Lecture Content


### Rules for Exponents

Let \( a > 0 \), and \( m, n \in \mathbb{R} \):

- \( a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n} \)
- \( \frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n} \)
- \( (a^m)^n = a^{mn} \)
- \( (ab)^n = a^n b^n \)
- \( a^0 = 1 \)
- \( a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n} \)

### Rules for Logarithms

Let \( a > 0 \), \( a \neq 1 \), and \( x, y > 0 \):

- \( \log_a(xy) = \log_a(x) + \log_a(y) \)
- \( \log_a\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \log_a(x) - \log_a(y) \)
- \( \log_a(x^n) = n \cdot \log_a(x) \)
- \( \log_a(a) = 1 \)
- \( \log_a(1) = 0 \)

### Finding an Exponential Equation from Two Points

To find \( f(x) = C \cdot a^x \) that passes through points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \):

1. Set up the system:
   \[
   y_1 = C \cdot a^{x_1} \\
   y_2 = C \cdot a^{x_2}
   \]

2. Divide the two equations to eliminate \( C \):
   \[
   \frac{y_2}{y_1} = \frac{a^{x_2}}{a^{x_1}} = a^{x_2 - x_1}
   \]

3. Solve for \( a \):
   \[
   a = \left( \frac{y_2}{y_1} \right)^{\frac{1}{x_2 - x_1}}
   \]

4. Plug back into one equation to solve for \( C \).

---

### Solving Exponential and Logarithmic Equations

#### Exponential Equations{-}

To solve \( a^{f(x)} = b \):

1. Take logarithms of both sides:
   \[
   \log(a^{f(x)}) = \log(b)
   \]

2. Use the power rule:
   \[
   f(x) \cdot \log(a) = \log(b)
   \]

3. Solve for \( x \).

---

#### Logarithmic Equations {-}

To solve \( \log_a(f(x)) = b \):

1. Rewrite in exponential form:
   \[
   f(x) = a^b
   \]

2. Solve the resulting algebraic equation for \( x \).

---

### Applications and Formulas

#### Continuous Compounding {-}

If interest is compounded continuously:

\[
A = Pe^{rt}
\]

Where:
- \( A \) = final amount
- \( P \) = principal
- \( r \) = annual interest rate
- \( t \) = time in years
- \( e \approx 2.718 \)

---

#### Total Revenue from Demand Function {-}

If price \( p(x) \) depends on demand \( x \) (e.g. \( p(x) = 120 - 3x \)), then:

\[
R(x) = x \cdot p(x)
\]

Where:
- \( R(x) \) = total revenue
- \( x \) = quantity sold
- \( p(x) \) = price per unit as a function of demand

You can expand and simplify to analyze maximum revenue using calculus or vertex form (if quadratic).
