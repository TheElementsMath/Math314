### Basic Antiderivatives and Rules

Antiderivatives are the reverse of derivatives. The antiderivative of a function \( f(x) \) is a function \( F(x) \) such that:

\[
F'(x) = f(x)
\]

The indefinite integral of \( f(x) \) is:

\[
\int f(x) \, dx = F(x) + C
\]

Where \( C \) is the constant of integration.


#### Rules of Antidifferentiation

- **Sum Rule:**  
  \[
  \int (f(x) + g(x))\,dx = \int f(x)\,dx + \int g(x)\,dx
  \]

- **Constant Multiple Rule:**  
  \[
  \int c \cdot f(x)\,dx = c \cdot \int f(x)\,dx
  \]

- **Power Rule:**
  \[
  \int x^n\,dx =   \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C  \text{ for } n \ne -1 
  \]

- **Exponential Rule:**
  \[
  \int e^x \,dx = e^x + C
  \]

- **Reciprocal Rule:**
  \[
  \int \frac{1}{x} \,dx =  \ln|x| + C
  \]

#### Common Antiderivatives

| Function \( f(x) \)           | Antiderivative \( \int f(x)\,dx \)       |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| \( x^n \) (for \( n \ne -1 \)) | \( \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C \)             |
| \( \frac{1}{x} \)             | \( \ln|x| + C \)                          |
| \( e^x \)                     | \( e^x + C \)                             |
| \( a^x \)                     | \( \frac{a^x}{\ln a} + C \)               |
| \( \sin x \)                  | \( -\cos x + C \)                         |
| \( \cos x \)                  | \( \sin x + C \)                          |
| \( \sec^2 x \)                | \( \tan x + C \)                          |
| \( \sec x \tan x \)           | \( \sec x + C \)                          |

### Integration by Substitution

Substitution is used when the integrand contains a composite function.

#### Steps:

1. **Choose a substitution:**  
   Let \( u = g(x) \), where \( g(x) \) is an inner function.

2. **Differentiate \( u \):**  
   Compute \( du = g'(x)\,dx \).

3. **Rewrite the integral:**  
   Replace all \( x \)-terms with \( u \)-terms.

4. **Integrate in terms of \( u \).**

5. **Substitute back:**  
   Replace \( u \) with the original expression.

**Example:**

\[
\int 2x \cos(x^2) \, dx
\]

Let \( u = x^2 \), then \( du = 2x \, dx \).  
So the integral becomes:

\[
\int \cos(u) \, du = \sin(u) + C = \sin(x^2) + C
\]

---

### Integration by Parts

Use this method when the integrand is a product of two functions.

#### Formula:

\[
\int u\,dv = uv - \int v\,du
\]

#### Steps:

1. **Choose \( u \)** and **\( dv \)** from the integrand.
   - Use **LIPET** (Logarithmic, Inverse trig, Polynomial, Exponential, Trig) as a guide for choosing \( u \).

2. **Differentiate \( u \)** to get \( du \), and **integrate \( dv \)** to get \( v \).

3. **Apply the formula:**  
   \[
   \int u\,dv = uv - \int v\,du
   \]

4. **Simplify and integrate again if necessary.**

**Example:**

\[
\int x e^x \, dx
\]

Let \( u = x \), \( dv = e^x dx \)  
Then \( du = dx \), \( v = e^x \)

\[
\int x e^x \, dx = x e^x - \int e^x \, dx = x e^x - e^x + C
\]

## Lecture Notes

### Estimating Area Using \( n \) Rectangles

To estimate the area under a curve \( f(x) \) on an interval \([a, b]\), divide the interval into \( n \) subintervals of equal width:

\[
\Delta x = \frac{b - a}{n}
\]

Choose either **left endpoints** or **right endpoints** to evaluate the function:

- **Left Endpoint Approximation (LRAM):**

\[
A \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_{i-1}) \Delta x
\]

- **Right Endpoint Approximation (RRAM):**

\[
A \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \Delta x
\]

Where:

\[
x_i = a + i\Delta x, \quad x_{i-1} = a + (i-1)\Delta x
\]

These methods give a numerical estimate of the area under the curve.

---

### Properties of Summation Notation

For any constants \( c \), and functions \( f(i) \), \( g(i) \):

1. **Linearity:**

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} [f(i) + g(i)] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(i) + \sum_{i=1}^{n} g(i)
\]

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} c \cdot f(i) = c \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(i)
\]

2. **Additive Indexing:**

\[
\sum_{i=m}^{n} f(i) = f(m) + f(m+1) + \dots + f(n)
\]

---

### Summation Formulas

These formulas are useful for simplifying Riemann sum expressions:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 = n
\]

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3 = \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^2
\]

---

### Limit Definition of the Definite Integral

The definite integral of \( f(x) \) from \( a \) to \( b \) is defined as the limit of Riemann sums:

\[
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x
\]

Where:
- \( \Delta x = \frac{b - a}{n} \) is the width of each subinterval,
- \( x_i^* \) is any sample point in the \( i \)th subinterval \([x_{i-1}, x_i]\).

This definition captures the **exact area under the curve** as the number of rectangles \( n \) increases without bound and their width approaches zero.

$$\int_{1}^{3} (2x+3) \, dx$$

$$v(t) = 600(1 - e^{-0.5t})$$

# The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus



## Lecture Content

[**Video:  The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**](https://youtu.be/BVOSn1Gwqhs)

---



## Lecture Notes

### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus – Part I

Let \( f \) be a continuous function on the interval \([a, b]\), and define a function:

\[
F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\,dt
\]

Then \( F \) is continuous on \([a, b] \), differentiable on \( (a, b) \), and:

\[
F'(x) = f(x)
\]

**Interpretation:**

The derivative of the area function \( F(x) \) gives back the original function \( f(x) \). This connects **differentiation** and **integration**.

---

### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus – Part II

Let \( f \) be continuous on \([a, b]\), and let \( F \) be any antiderivative of \( f \) on that interval. Then:

\[
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a)
\]

**Interpretation:**

To evaluate a definite integral, find **any** antiderivative \( F \), and compute the difference \( F(b) - F(a) \). This allows us to compute exact areas without using limits or Riemann sums.

---

### Properties of Definite Integrals

Let \( f(x) \), \( g(x) \) be continuous on \([a, b]\), and let \( c \) be a constant. The following properties hold:

1. **Linearity:**

\[
\int_a^b [f(x) \pm g(x)]\,dx = \int_a^b f(x)\,dx \pm \int_a^b g(x)\,dx
\]

\[
\int_a^b c \cdot f(x)\,dx = c \cdot \int_a^b f(x)\,dx
\]

2. **Additivity over Intervals:**

\[
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx + \int_b^c f(x)\,dx = \int_a^c f(x)\,dx
\]

3. **Reversing Limits:**

\[
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = -\int_b^a f(x)\,dx
\]

4. **Zero-Width Interval:**

\[
\int_a^a f(x)\,dx = 0
\]

5. **Comparison Property (if \( f(x) \ge g(x) \)):**

\[
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx \ge \int_a^b g(x)\,dx
\]

6. **Absolute Value Inequality:**

\[
\left| \int_a^b f(x)\,dx \right| \le \int_a^b |f(x)|\,dx
\]

# Area between Curves



## Lecture Content

[**Video:  Area Between Curves**](https://youtu.be/PfYcOdCgygk)


---


## Lecture Notes

### Definite Integrals as Net Area

The definite integral \( \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \) represents the **net area** between the graph of \( f(x) \) and the \( x \)-axis over the interval \([a, b]\):

- If \( f(x) \ge 0 \) on \([a, b]\), the integral gives the total area above the \( x \)-axis.
- If \( f(x) \le 0 \) on \([a, b]\), the integral gives the negative of the area below the \( x \)-axis.
- If \( f(x) \) changes sign on \([a, b] \), the integral gives the **net area**: area above minus area below.

**Note:** To find the **total area**, regardless of sign, use:

\[
\text{Total area} = \int_a^b |f(x)| \, dx
\]

---

### Simple Improper Integrals

An **improper integral** arises when:

1. The interval is **infinite**, e.g., \( \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx \)
2. The integrand is **unbounded** at a point in the interval, e.g., \( \int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx \)

#### Infinite Interval Example:

\[
\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx = \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_1^b \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx = \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( -\frac{1}{x} \Big|_1^b \right) = 1
\]

#### Unbounded Function Example:

\[
\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx = \lim_{a \to 0^+} \int_a^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx = \lim_{a \to 0^+} (2\sqrt{x} \big|_a^1) = 2
\]

An improper integral **converges** if the limit exists, and **diverges** if the limit does not exist.

To find the area between two curves \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) on \([a, b]\), where \( f(x) \ge g(x) \):

\[
\text{Area} = \int_a^b [f(x) - g(x)] \, dx
\]

**Steps:**

1. **Find points of intersection:** Solve \( f(x) = g(x) \) to find the limits of integration.
2. **Identify top and bottom functions** on the interval.
3. **Set up and evaluate the integral:**  
   - If necessary, split the interval where the curves switch order.
4. For vertical slices (functions of \( y \)), use:
   \[
   \int_{c}^{d} [f(y) - g(y)] \, dy
   \]

**Example:**

Find the area between \( y = x^2 \) and \( y = x \):

1. Intersection points: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 1 \)
2. \( x \ge 0 \Rightarrow x \ge x^2 \)
3. Area:
   \[
   \int_0^1 (x - x^2) \, dx = \left[ \frac{x^2}{2} - \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6}
   \]

### Sketching the Feasible Region

To solve a linear programming problem involving maximization, start by identifying the feasible region — the set of all possible solutions that satisfy the constraints.

#### Steps:

1. **Define the variables.**  
   - Assign \( x \), \( y \), etc., to represent the quantities in the problem.

2. **Write the system of inequalities.**  
   - These represent the constraints.

3. **Graph each inequality:**
   - Convert to an equation to graph the boundary.
   - Use a solid line for \( \leq \) or \( \geq \), dashed for \( < \) or \( > \).
   - Shade the correct side of each line.

4. **Identify the feasible region:**
   - The region where all shaded areas **overlap**.
   - It must also satisfy non-negativity constraints (e.g., \( x \ge 0 \), \( y \ge 0 \)).

5. **Label the corner (vertex) points** of the feasible region.  
   - These are typically found at the intersections of constraint lines.

---

### Maximizing the Objective Function

Once the feasible region is identified and corner points are known, the objective function can be evaluated.

#### Steps:

1. **Write the objective function:**  
   - Usually in the form \( P = ax + by \), where \( a \), \( b \) are constants.

2. **Plug each corner point** into the objective function to calculate \( P \).

3. **Compare the results:**
   - The **largest value** is the **maximum**.
   - The **smallest value** is the **minimum**, if needed.

4. **State the optimal solution:**
   - Report both the point \( (x, y) \) and the maximum value \( P \).

---

## Example

Maximize \( P = 3x + 5y \), subject to:

\[
\begin{align*}
x + y &\le 4 \\
x &\le 2 \\
y &\le 3 \\
x, y &\ge 0
\end{align*}
\]

**Feasible Region:**  
- Graph constraints and find the overlapping area.

**Corner Points:**  
- \( (0,0), (0,3), (1,3), (2,2), (2,0) \)

**Evaluate \( P \):**
- \( P(0,0) = 0 \)
- \( P(0,3) = 15 \)
- \( P(1,3) = 18 \)
- \( P(2,2) = 16 \)
- \( P(2,0) = 6 \)

**Maximum:**  
- At \( (1,3) \), maximum \( P = 18 \)

---

# Lecture Notes

### Evaluation of Functions of Two Variables

A function of two variables has the form:
\[
f(x, y)
\]
To evaluate the function, simply substitute values for both \( x \) and \( y \).

**Example:**

If \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \), then:
\[
f(2, 3) = 2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13
\]
Functions of two variables are often visualized as surfaces in 3D space.

---

### Finding Partial Derivatives

A **partial derivative** measures the rate of change of a function with respect to one variable while keeping the other constant.

#### Notation:

- Partial derivative with respect to \( x \):  
  \[
  f_x(x, y) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}
  \]

- Partial derivative with respect to \( y \):  
  \[
  f_y(x, y) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
  \]

**Example:**

For \( f(x, y) = x^2y + y^3 \):

- \( f_x = 2xy \)
- \( f_y = x^2 + 3y^2 \)

Higher-order partial derivatives include:

- \( f_{xx}, f_{yy}, f_{xy}, f_{yx} \)

---

### Clairaut’s Theorem (Equality of Mixed Partials)

Clairaut’s Theorem states that if the mixed partial derivatives \( f_{xy} \) and \( f_{yx} \) are **continuous** near a point, then:

\[
f_{xy} = f_{yx}
\]

This means the order of differentiation does **not** matter under reasonable conditions (i.e., if the function is sufficiently smooth).

---

### D-Test for Classifying Critical Points

To classify critical points of a function \( f(x, y) \), use the **Second Derivative Test (D-test)**.

#### Steps:

1. **Find critical points** by solving:

\[
f_x = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad f_y = 0
\]

2. **Compute second-order partial derivatives:**

\[
f_{xx}, f_{yy}, f_{xy}
\]

3. **Calculate the discriminant:**

\[
D = f_{xx} f_{yy} - (f_{xy})^2
\]

4. **Classify the critical point:**

- If \( D > 0 \) and \( f_{xx} > 0 \): **Local minimum**
- If \( D > 0 \) and \( f_{xx} < 0 \): **Local maximum**
- If \( D < 0 \): **Saddle point**
- If \( D = 0 \): **Inconclusive**

---

**Example:**

Let \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \)

- \( f_x = 2x, f_y = 2y \Rightarrow \text{critical point at } (0, 0) \)
- \( f_{xx} = 2, f_{yy} = 2, f_{xy} = 0 \)
- \( D = (2)(2) - 0 = 4 > 0 \), and \( f_{xx} = 2 > 0 \)

→ **Local minimum at (0, 0)**
