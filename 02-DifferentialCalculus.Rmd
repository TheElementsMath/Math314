### Rules for Exponents

Let \( a > 0 \), and \( m, n \in \mathbb{R} \):

- \( a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n} \)
- \( \frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n} \)
- \( (a^m)^n = a^{mn} \)
- \( (ab)^n = a^n b^n \)
- \( a^0 = 1 \)
- \( a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n} \)

### Rules for Logarithms

Let \( a > 0 \), \( a \neq 1 \), and \( x, y > 0 \):

- \( \log_a(xy) = \log_a(x) + \log_a(y) \)
- \( \log_a\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \log_a(x) - \log_a(y) \)
- \( \log_a(x^n) = n \cdot \log_a(x) \)
- \( \log_a(a) = 1 \)
- \( \log_a(1) = 0 \)

### Finding an Exponential Equation from Two Points

To find \( f(x) = C \cdot a^x \) that passes through points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \):

1. Set up the system:
   \[
   y_1 = C \cdot a^{x_1} \\
   y_2 = C \cdot a^{x_2}
   \]

2. Divide the two equations to eliminate \( C \):
   \[
   \frac{y_2}{y_1} = \frac{a^{x_2}}{a^{x_1}} = a^{x_2 - x_1}
   \]

3. Solve for \( a \):
   \[
   a = \left( \frac{y_2}{y_1} \right)^{\frac{1}{x_2 - x_1}}
   \]

4. Plug back into one equation to solve for \( C \).

---

### Solving Exponential and Logarithmic Equations

#### Exponential Equations{-}

To solve \( a^{f(x)} = b \):

1. Take logarithms of both sides:
   \[
   \log(a^{f(x)}) = \log(b)
   \]

2. Use the power rule:
   \[
   f(x) \cdot \log(a) = \log(b)
   \]

3. Solve for \( x \).

---

#### Logarithmic Equations {-}

To solve \( \log_a(f(x)) = b \):

1. Rewrite in exponential form:
   \[
   f(x) = a^b
   \]

2. Solve the resulting algebraic equation for \( x \).

---

### Applications and Formulas

#### Continuous Compounding {-}

If interest is compounded continuously:

\[
A = Pe^{rt}
\]

Where:
- \( A \) = final amount
- \( P \) = principal
- \( r \) = annual interest rate
- \( t \) = time in years
- \( e \approx 2.718 \)

---

#### Total Revenue from Demand Function {-}

If price \( p(x) \) depends on demand \( x \) (e.g. \( p(x) = 120 - 3x \)), then:

\[
R(x) = x \cdot p(x)
\]

Where:
- \( R(x) \) = total revenue
- \( x \) = quantity sold
- \( p(x) \) = price per unit as a function of demand

You can expand and simplify to analyze maximum revenue using calculus or vertex form (if quadratic).

# Limits and Continuity




## Lecture Content

[**Video:  Numerical and Graphical Approaches to Limits**](https://youtu.be/FPlR88H9_A0)

[**Video:  Limits and Continuity**](https://youtu.be/eloHCkPZwos)



### Estimate a Limit Using a Table of Values

To estimate a limit using a table:

- Choose values of \( x \) that get closer to the target from both sides (left and right).
- Observe how the function values \( f(x) \) behave.
- If the values approach a single number, that is the estimated limit.

**Example:**
If \( f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \), use values close to 1 (e.g., 0.9, 0.99, 1.01, 1.1) to estimate \( \lim_{x \to 1} f(x) \).

### Use Factoring to Evaluate Limits

Factoring helps eliminate indeterminate forms like \( \frac{0}{0} \).

**Steps:**

1. Factor the numerator and denominator.
2. Cancel common factors.
3. Substitute the limit value.

**Example:**
Evaluate \( \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2} \):
\[
\frac{(x - 2)(x + 2)}{x - 2} = x + 2 \Rightarrow \lim_{x \to 2} = 4
\]

### One-Sided Limits and Vertical Asymptotes

- **Left-hand limit:** \( \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) \)
- **Right-hand limit:** \( \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) \)

If the function approaches infinity or negative infinity near a point, it may indicate a vertical asymptote.

**Example:**
\[
\lim_{x \to 0^-} \frac{1}{x} = -\infty,\quad
\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = \infty
\]

### Dominant Term Analysis for Limits at Infinity

To evaluate limits as \( x \to \infty \), focus on the **dominant (highest degree)** terms.

**Steps:**

1. Identify the highest power term in the numerator and denominator.
2. Divide all terms by the dominant power of \( x \).
3. Simplify and take the limit.

**Example:**
\[
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{3x^2 + 5}{x^2 - 2x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{3 + 5/x^2}{1 - 2/x} = \frac{3}{1} = 3
\]

### Continuity of Piecewise Functions

To determine if a piecewise function is continuous at a point:

1. **Check function is defined:** \( f(a) \) exists.
2. **Evaluate both one-sided limits:** \( \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) \) and \( \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) \).
3. **Check limit equals value:** \( \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a) \)

If all three conditions are met, the function is continuous at \( x = a \).

**Example:**

\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
x^2, & x < 2 \\
4x - 4, & x \geq 2
\end{cases}
\]

Check continuity at \( x = 2 \):
- \( f(2) = 4 \)
- \( \lim_{x \to 2^-} = 4 \), \( \lim_{x \to 2^+} = 4 \)
- Since limits and value agree: **continuous**



## Practice Problems


Practice the techniques discussed in class and in the online videos by solving the following examples.

1. Estimate $\lim_{x \to 2} e^{x-2}$.

2. Estimate $\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{-2}{x^2}$.

3. Evaluate $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x-3}{x-1}$.

4. Evaluate $\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x^{2} - 8x + 12}{x-2}$.

5. Evaluate $\lim_{x \to -2} \frac{x+2}{x^{2} - 4}$.

6. Evaluate $\lim_{x \to \infty} e^{-x}$.

7. Evaluate $\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{3x - x^{6} + 2}{3x^{3} + 2x}$.

8. Evaluate $\lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{1 - 3x}{2x^{2} + 3}$.

9. Find a number $b$ so that 
$$
f(x) = \begin{cases} 
5x - 6 & x \leq 2 \\
-3x + b & x > 2
\end{cases}
$$
is continuous everywhere.

10. Find a number $a$ so that 
$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
ax - 3 & x \leq 3 \\
x + a & x > 3
\end{cases}
$$
is continuous everywhere.

11. (Applied) The percentage of movie advertising as a share of newspapers’ total advertising revenue from 1995 to 2004 can be approximated by
$$
p(t) = \begin{cases}
-0.07t + 6 & t \leq 4 \\
0.3t + 17 & t > 4
\end{cases}
$$
where $t$ is the time since 1995.

   a. Compute $\lim_{t \to 4^-} p(t)$ and $\lim_{t \to 4^+} p(t)$ and interpret each answer.

   b. Is the function $p$ continuous at $t = 4$? What does the answer tell you about newspaper revenues?

# The Limit Definition of the Derivative






## Lecture Content

[**Video:  Average Rate of Change**](https://youtu.be/0lMCRhUcCtA)

[**Video:  Introduction to the Derivative**](https://youtu.be/yuNhYRZREwI)

[**Video:  Powers, Sums and Constant Multiples**](https://youtu.be/cfP_04TuJc8)



### Limit Definition of the Derivative

The derivative of a function \( f(x) \) at a point \( x = a \) is defined as:

\[
f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}
\]

Alternatively, using \( x \):

\[
f'(x) = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}
\]

This represents the **instantaneous rate of change** or the **slope of the tangent line** to the curve at \( x = a \).

### Derivative Rules for Common Functions

#### Polynomials
\[
\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}
\]

#### Exponential Functions
\[
\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x, \quad \frac{d}{dx}(a^x) = a^x \ln a
\]

#### Logarithmic Functions
\[
\frac{d}{dx}(\ln x) = \frac{1}{x}, \quad \frac{d}{dx}(\log_a x) = \frac{1}{x \ln a}
\]

#### Trigonometric Functions
\[
\frac{d}{dx}(\sin x) = \cos x, \quad \frac{d}{dx}(\cos x) = -\sin x
\]
\[
\frac{d}{dx}(\tan x) = \sec^2 x
\]

### Sum, Difference, and Constant Multiple Rules

- **Sum Rule:**  
\[
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) + g(x)] = f'(x) + g'(x)
\]

- **Difference Rule:**  
\[
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) - g(x)] = f'(x) - g'(x)
\]

- **Constant Multiple Rule:**  
\[
\frac{d}{dx}[c \cdot f(x)] = c \cdot f'(x)
\]

These rules allow for simple combination and manipulation of derivative calculations.

### Tangent Line to a Function at a Point

To find the equation of the tangent line to \( f(x) \) at \( x = a \):

1. **Find \( f(a) \)** – the point of tangency: \( (a, f(a)) \).
2. **Compute \( f'(a) \)** – the slope of the tangent line.
3. **Use point-slope form:**

\[
y - f(a) = f'(a)(x - a)
\]

This gives the linear approximation of the function near \( x = a \).

**Example:**

Find the tangent line to \( f(x) = x^2 \) at \( x = 3 \):

- \( f(3) = 9 \)
- \( f'(x) = 2x \Rightarrow f'(3) = 6 \)
- Equation: \( y - 9 = 6(x - 3) \Rightarrow y = 6x - 9 \)



## Practice Problems

1. Use the limit definition of a derivative to find the derivative of $f(x) = x^{2} - 3$.

2. Use the limit definition of a derivative to find the derivative of $f(x) = \frac{2}{x^{2}}$.

3. Differentiate the following functions:

   d. $g(x) = 5^{x} + e^{x}$.

   e. $y = 4x^{-1} - 2|x| - 10 + \sin(x)$.

   f. $f(x) = 3x^{3} - 2x^{2} + \sqrt{x}$.

   g. $f(x) = 5 \sin(x) + \ln(x)$.

   h. $f(x) = \cos(x) - 3 \sin(x) + e^{x}$.

4. Find the equation of the tangent line to the equation below at the indicated point:

   a. $f(x) = x + \frac{1}{x}$ at $x=2$.

   b. $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^{2}}$ at $x=1$.

   c. $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ at $x=4$.

5. (Applied) Company C’s profits are given by $P(0) = \$1$ million and $P'(0) = \$0.5$ million/month. Company D’s profits are given by $P(0) = \$0.5$ million and $P'(0) = \$1$ million/month. In which company would you rather invest? Why?

6. (Applied) The cost of producing $x$ teddy bears per day at the Cuddly Companion Co. is calculated by their marketing staff to be given by the formula
$$
C(x) = 100 + 40x - 0.001 x^{2}.

# The Product and Quotient Rules



## Lecture Content

[**Video:  The Product and Quotient Rules**](https://youtu.be/hyq3m2K10fI)



### Product Rule for Two Functions

If \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are differentiable, then the derivative of their product is:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)
\]

**Mnemonic:** "First times the derivative of the second, plus second times the derivative of the first."

---

### Product Rule for Three Functions

If \( f(x), g(x), h(x) \) are differentiable, then the derivative of their product is:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)h(x)] = f'(x)g(x)h(x) + f(x)g'(x)h(x) + f(x)g(x)h'(x)
\]

**Tip:** Differentiate one function at a time, keeping the other two unchanged, and sum the results.

---

### Quotient Rule

If \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are differentiable and \( g(x) \ne 0 \), then:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right] = \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}
\]

**Mnemonic:** "Low D high minus high D low, over low squared."

# The Chain Rule and L'Hopital's Rule





## Lecture Content

[**Video:  L'Hospital's Rule**](https://youtu.be/sZv3uLLOwFc)

### Derivative of a Composition of Functions (Chain Rule)

If a function is defined as a composition \( y = f(g(x)) \), then the derivative is given by the **chain rule**:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
\]

**In Leibniz notation:**
If \( y = f(u) \) and \( u = g(x) \), then:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}
\]

**Example:**
\[
\text{If } y = \sin(x^2), \text{ then } \frac{dy}{dx} = \cos(x^2) \cdot 2x
\]

---

### L'Hôpital's Rule

L’Hôpital’s Rule provides a method to evaluate limits of indeterminate forms \( \frac{0}{0} \) or \( \frac{\infty}{\infty} \).

#### Statement of the Rule

Let \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) be differentiable near \( a \), and suppose:

- \( \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = 0 \), or
- \( \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = \infty \)

and

- \( g'(x) \ne 0 \) near \( a \), and
- \( \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} \) exists (or is \( \pm\infty \)),

then:

\[
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
\]

**Note:** The rule also applies as \( x \to \infty \) or \( x \to -\infty \).

---

**Example:**
\[
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = \frac{0}{0} \Rightarrow \text{Apply L'Hôpital's Rule:} \quad \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos x}{1} = 1
\]

## Practice Problems


Practice the techniques discussed in class and in the online videos by solving the following examples.

1. Differentiate:
   a. $f(x) = (3x - 1)^{10}$
   
   b. $y = (1 - x)^{-1}$
   
   c. $v(x) = 3^{2x + 1} + e^{3x + 1}$

2. Differentiate:
   a. $f(x) = (x^2 + 1)^5 \ln x$
   
   b. $f(x) = \frac{1}{(x + 1)^2}$
   
   c. $g(x) = \ln(x^2 + 3)$

3. Differentiate:
   a. $h(x) = \ln \left(\frac{9x}{4x - 2}\right)$
   
   b. $h(x) = 2[(x + 1)(x^2 - 1)]^{-1/2}$
   
   c. $h(x) = 3^{x^2 - x}$


4. Verify L'Hopital's Rule can be applied, and then use it to evaluate the limit. Sometimes you may have to apply the rule more than once.

   a. $$\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^2 - 2x + 1}{x^2 - x}$$
   
   b. $$\lim_{x \to -2} \frac{x^3 + 8}{x^2 + 3x + 2}$$
   
   c. $$\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{6x^2 - 5x + 1}{3x^2 - 9}$$
   
   d. $$\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x}$$

4. Determine the limit: $$\lim_{x \to \frac{1}{2}} \frac{\sin(2x - 1)}{2x - 1}$$

5. The total spent on research and development by the federal government in the United States during 1995–2007 can be approximated by

$$

where $t$ is the year since 1990. What was the total spent in 2005 $(t = 15)$ and how fast was it increasing?

# Implicit Differentiation






## Lecture Content


[**Video:  Higher Order Derivatives**](https://youtu.be/wgX5LHbb6pE)

[**Video:  Derivatives of Logarithmic and Exponential Functions**](https://youtu.be/UeazZ3n_n20)

[**Video:  Implicit Differentiation**](https://youtu.be/s6_iOkjPnD4)


### Higher-Order Derivatives

Higher-order derivatives are the successive derivatives of a function.

- **First derivative:** \( f'(x) \) — represents the rate of change or slope.
- **Second derivative:** \( f''(x) \) — measures the rate of change of the first derivative (i.e., concavity or acceleration).
- **Third and beyond:** \( f^{(3)}(x), f^{(4)}(x), \ldots \) are called third, fourth, etc., derivatives.

**Notation:**

- \( f^{(n)}(x) \) is the \( n \)th derivative.
- In physics, these can represent velocity, acceleration, jerk, etc.

**Example:**
If \( f(x) = x^3 \):

- \( f'(x) = 3x^2 \)
- \( f''(x) = 6x \)
- \( f^{(3)}(x) = 6 \)

---

### Implicit Differentiation

Implicit differentiation is used when a function is not given in the form \( y = f(x) \), but instead in an implicit form, like an equation involving both \( x \) and \( y \).

#### Steps:

1. **Differentiate both sides** of the equation with respect to \( x \).  
   - Treat \( y \) as a function of \( x \) (i.e., apply the chain rule to any term involving \( y \)).
2. **Apply the chain rule:**  
   - When differentiating terms with \( y \), include \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) (or \( y' \)).
3. **Solve for \( \frac{dy}{dx} \)** (i.e., isolate the derivative on one side).

---

**Example:**
Given \( x^2 + y^2 = 25 \), find \( \frac{dy}{dx} \):

1. Differentiate both sides:
\[
\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) + \frac{d}{dx}(y^2) = \frac{d}{dx}(25)
\Rightarrow 2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0
\]

2. Solve for \( \frac{dy}{dx} \):
\[
2y \frac{dy}{dx} = -2x \Rightarrow \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}
\]

---




## Practice Problems

1. Find the first $n$ derivatives of $$f(x) = -3x^3 + 4x.$$

2. Find $dy/dx$ given $$x^2 y - y^2 = 4.$$

3. Find $dy/dx$ given $$3xy - \frac{y}{x} = 2.$$

4. Find $dy/dx$ given $$y \ln x + y = 2.$$

5. Find $dy/dx$ given $$x e^y = y e^x.$$

6. Differentiate $$y = \frac{(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)}{x(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)}.$$

7. Find the tangent line to $$e^{-xy} + 2x = 1$$ at $x = -1$.

8. (Applied) An employment research company estimates that the value of a recent MBA graduate to an accounting company is 
$$
V = 3e^2 + 5g^3,
$$
where $V$ is the value of the graduate, $e$ is the number of years of prior business experience, and $g$ is the graduate school grade point average. If $V$ is fixed at 200, find $de/dg$ when $g = 3.0$ and interpret the result.

9. (Applied) Use logarithmic differentiation to give a proof of the quotient rule.

[**Video:  Maxima and Minima**](https://youtu.be/mM0A9Kv_wYw)


### Finding Critical Numbers

Critical numbers occur where the first or second derivative is zero or undefined.

#### Steps for the First Derivative \( f'(x) \):

1. Find \( f'(x) \).
2. Solve \( f'(x) = 0 \) or where \( f'(x) \) is undefined.
3. The values of \( x \) where this occurs are **critical numbers** (provided \( x \) is in the domain of \( f \)).

#### Steps for the Second Derivative \( f''(x) \):

1. Find \( f''(x) \).
2. Solve \( f''(x) = 0 \) or where \( f''(x) \) is undefined.
3. These are **possible inflection points** (to be confirmed by a sign change).

---

### Classifying Maximums, Minimums, and Inflection Points

#### First Derivative Test (for relative extrema):

- If \( f'(x) \) changes from positive to negative at \( x = c \), then \( f(c) \) is a **local maximum**.
- If \( f'(x) \) changes from negative to positive at \( x = c \), then \( f(c) \) is a **local minimum**.

#### Second Derivative Test (for local extrema):

- If \( f'(c) = 0 \) and \( f''(c) > 0 \), then \( f(c) \) is a **local minimum**.
- If \( f'(c) = 0 \) and \( f''(c) < 0 \), then \( f(c) \) is a **local maximum**.
- If \( f''(c) = 0 \), the test is inconclusive.

#### Inflection Points:

- A point \( x = c \) is an **inflection point** if:
  - \( f''(x) \) changes sign at \( x = c \), and
  - \( f \) is continuous at \( x = c \)

---

### Extreme Value Theorem (EVT)

The **Extreme Value Theorem** states:

> If a function \( f(x) \) is continuous on a closed interval \([a, b]\), then \( f(x) \) has both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum on that interval.

#### To find the absolute extrema:

1. Find critical numbers of \( f(x) \) in the interval \([a, b]\).
2. Evaluate \( f(x) \) at:
   - Each critical number in \([a, b]\)
   - The endpoints \( a \) and \( b \)
3. Compare all function values. The largest is the **absolute maximum**, and the smallest is the **absolute minimum**.

---

### Intervals of Increase, Decrease, and Concavity

#### Increasing/Decreasing Intervals:

1. Find \( f'(x) \) and critical points.
2. Make a sign chart for \( f'(x) \).
3. If \( f'(x) > 0 \) on an interval, then \( f(x) \) is **increasing** there.
4. If \( f'(x) < 0 \) on an interval, then \( f(x) \) is **decreasing** there.

#### Concavity and Inflection Points:

1. Find \( f''(x) \) and solve \( f''(x) = 0 \).
2. Make a sign chart for \( f''(x) \).
3. If \( f''(x) > 0 \), then \( f(x) \) is **concave up**.
4. If \( f''(x) < 0 \), then \( f(x) \) is **concave down**.
5. Points where concavity changes are **inflection points**.

---

7. Sketch the graph of $$h(x) = -2x^3 - 3x^2 + 36x.$$

8. Sketch the graph of $$f(t) = \frac{t^2 - 1}{t^2 + 1}.$$

9. (Applied) Maximize $$P = xy$$ with $$x + 2y = 40.$$

10. (Applied) The cost of controlling emissions at a firm rises rapidly as the amount of emissions reduced increases. Here is a possible model: 

$$
C(q) = 4,000 + 100 q^2
$$

where $q$ is the reduction in emissions (in pounds of pollutant per day) and $C$ is the daily cost to the firm (in dollars) of this reduction. What level of reduction corresponds to the lowest average cost per pound of pollutant, and what would be the resulting average cost to the nearest dollar?

2. Find and classify the critical points and locate all inflection points for $$f(x) = x e^{-x^2}.$$

3. Sketch the graph of $$g(x) = \frac{x^3}{x^2 - 3}.$$

$$
q = 200,000 - 10,000 p
$$
copies, but each copy costs \$4 to make. What price will give the greatest profit?

5. Let 
$$
f(x) = \frac{N}{1 + A e^{-k x}}
$$
for constants $N$, $A$, and $k$ ($A$ and $k$ positive). Show that $f$ has a single point of inflection at $$x = \frac{\ln A}{k}.$$
